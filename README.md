Repositories that leverage GitHub's Release feature can be considered usable as they have undergone some level of testing and I have some level of assurance they work as intended.

Repositories that do not have associated releases should be considered experimental but are published in the hopes someone finds them informative and/or useful.

For classification purposes please be cognizant that just because a repository may have associated tags that doesn't mean it has associated releases.
